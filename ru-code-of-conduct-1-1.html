   <h3>
    Roads
   </h3>
   <p>
    All roads and paths that public traffic can drive or walk on. This
        includes bridges and tunnels. Paths and verges are also considered part
        of the road.
   </p>
   <p>
    This means that a road can be anything between two ditches or two walls.
        Pavements are therefore also part of the road, just like cycle paths
        that are separated from the road itself by a verge or pavement.

      crossing guards - who may only stop drivers.

  <h2>
   Mandatory co-operation
  </h2>
  <p>
   If you are stopped by a police officer or another authorised person, they
      may ask to see certain documents. These documents must be in your
      possession at all times, and you may not refuse a request to show them.
      These documents include:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Your driving licence.
   </li>
   <li>
    The vehicle’s registration certificate.
   </li>
   <li>
    The supervisor pass if you are driving under the 2toDrive scheme
        (driving from 17 years of age).
   </li>
   <li>
    A disabled parking card if you are driving a disabled vehicle or parking
        in a disabled parking space.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   An authorised person may also require you to comply with an alcohol or
      drug test. This means you have to comply with a breath test, eye
      co-ordination and speech function test, and saliva swabs for drug
      detection purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
   You may even be required to submit to a blood test if you refuse a breath
      test or if it is not possible to do a breath test.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Hindering or endangering
  </h2>
  <p>
   Most rules are detailed in the applicable legislation. For example, you
      may not drive faster than the speed limit, you may not ignore traffic
      signs, and you may not drive through red lights. However, there are many
      other behaviours that could endanger other road users or impede the
      regular flow of traffic that are not explicitly recorded in legislation. A
      rule is therefore in place prohibiting road users from behaving in such a
      way as to create or contribute to a dangerous situation on the road.
      Obstructing or hindering other traffic is also prohibited. The cause of or
      reason for these behaviours is irrelevant.
  </p>
  <div class="important-words2">
   <div class="vertical-line2">
   </div>
   <h3>
    Kapstokartikel
   </h3>
   <p>
    Article 5 of the Road Traffic Act (also called ‘Kapstokartikel’)
        prohibits road users from operating a vehicle in such a way that it
        hinders traffic or causes danger to themselves or other road users. This
        law provides a so-called ‘safety net’ which covers dangerous behaviour
        that is not directly prohibited by traffic signs or road markings but
        still constitutes a hinder or danger and for which you may still be
        prosecuted.
   </p>
  </div>
  <h2>
   Injury or death at-fault
  </h2>
  <p>
   In addition to not being allowed to cause hinder or dangerous situations,
      road users should take care to avoid causing a traffic accident that could
      injure or kill others.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Leaving the scene of an accident
  </h2>
  <p>
   Have you been involved in a traffic accident? Then you may not leave the
      scene of the accident until you have exchanged your contact and vehicle
      information with any other people involved or the police – regardless of
      whether you were at fault or not.
  </p>
  <p>
   Leaving the scene of an accident without providing your information is a
      crime. You can mitigate this by voluntarily reporting to a police station
      within 12 hours from when the accident occurred. Unless the police
      arrested you as a suspect before then.
  </p>
  <div class="important-words2">
   <p>
    Leaving the scene of an accident while leaving an injured person without
        aid is always a crime – even if you report to the police later.
        Regardless of whether you were directly involved in the accident or not,
        you are obliged to provide help if needed.
   </p>
  </div>
  <h2>
   Racing on the road
  </h2>
  <p>
   Racing or competing with other drivers on public roads is prohibited. One
      example of this is rapidly accelerating at traffic lights. If a road user
      is caught doing this, both the driver and the vehicle owner are liable for
      any damages.
  </p>
  <div class="important-words2">

   <h3>
    Driving licence confiscation
   </h3>
   <p>
    Police officers are authorised to confiscate your driving licence if you
        are caught violating traffic regulations. Your licence will then be
        forwarded to the public prosecutor.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Driving disqualification (driving licence suspended)
   </h3>
   <p>
    Being disqualified from driving means you are not allowed to operate
        motor carriages for several weeks, months or even years. If you are
        caught violating traffic regulations, a public prosecutor or judge may
        disqualify you from driving. Driving disqualification may last up to two
        years for less severe infractions and up to five years for serious
        offences. The latter includes death or injury caused by dangerous
        driving, driving under the influence of alcohol, and driving while
        disqualified. If you commit another offence within a short time, these
        penalties may be doubled.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Driving licence invalidation
   </h3>
   <p>
    If you commit several offences, or if you are ineligible to drive for
        other reasons, your driving licence may be declared invalid. This means
        you are no longer permitted to operate motor carriages for which your
        licence is required. You will still be permitted to cycle, be a
        passenger in a vehicle, and operate vehicles that do not require a
        driving licence. Your licence may also be invalidated for one vehicle
        category only, which means you will remain eligible to operate vehicles
        in other categories.
   </p>
  </div>
  <img alt="Image 1" class="custom-centered-image" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/4b688f_f8ec58ada61a4f80817ec8b888ad80d0~mv2.jpg"/>
  <h2>
   Driving behaviour enforcement
  </h2>
  <p>
   If you are found in violation of traffic laws, your driving licence may be
      confiscated. This means the police will take your licence and forward it
      to the public prosecutor, who will then decide (within 10 days) whether to
      withhold your licence or return it to you. In either case, a judge may be
      asked to make the final decision, at which point you may be fined and/or
      disqualified from driving. You will no longer be permitted to drive a
      motor carriage for the duration of your disqualification.
  </p>
  <p>
   Based on your behaviour, confiscation of your driving licence, may happen
      if you:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    exceed the speed limit by 50 km/h or more;
   </li>
   <li>
    cause hinder or a dangerous situation.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The violation may also be reported to the CBR (Central Bureau for Driving
      Proficiency), who will then determine your eligibility to continue
      driving.
  </p>
  <div class="important-words2">
   <p>
    The abbreviation CBR stands for Centraal Bureau Rijvaardigheidsbewijzen,
        or Central Bureau for Driving Proficiency. They decide whether you
        qualify for a driving licence. They also decide whether you get to keep
        your driving licence when your eligibility or driving skills are called
        into question. The CBR oversees both theory and driving tests. Another
        branch of the CBR is the BNOR; if you fail your driving test four times
        consecutively, they will investigate further and determine your driving
        capabilities.
   </p>
  </div>
  <p>
   The CBR may be notified if you:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    tailgate on the motorway (you do not keep proper distance to the vehicle
        in front of you);
   </li>
   <li>
    cut off other road users;
   </li>
   <li>
    drive through a red light;
   </li>
   <li>
    exceed the speed limit by more than 50 km/h in normal situations;
   </li>
   <li>
    exceed the speed limit by more than 30 km/h where roadworks are
        underway.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
   Driving while disqualified
  </h2>
  <p>
   Operating a motor carriage while disqualified from driving is a criminal
      offence. This is also the case if you operate a vehicle for which a
      licence is required and your licence has been declared invalid.
